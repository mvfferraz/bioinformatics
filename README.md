# Bioinformatics Course Notes

This repository contains my notes, exercises, and small projects from a bioinformatics course.  
The course is divided into three main modules:

1. **Genomics** – Study of genomes, sequencing, and genome analysis.  
2. **Transcriptomics** – Analysis of RNA, gene expression, and differential expression.  
3. **Epigenetics** – Study of DNA modifications, chromatin structure, and regulatory mechanisms.

## Repository Structure

## How to Use

- Navigate into each module folder to read notes or check scripts.  
- I will gradually add example scripts, data analyses, and summaries as I progress through the course.
